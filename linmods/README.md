# Linear Models with Python

Early in my career, when I was just an R progammer, Julian Faraway's books, _Linear Models with R_, and _Extending the Linear Model with R_ were two of the best pedagogical materials I ever came across. When I discovered he had recently written a book on the subject for Python, I immediately wanted to review it to help fill any lingering gaps I might have in the Python universe, and I'm sure it will be a wonderful review as well.
